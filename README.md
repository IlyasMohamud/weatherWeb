# Weather Forecast Webpage

I created this webpage to improve my understanding of APIs and how to fetch, filter, and display data through them. This is a simple weather forecasting page where users can select a city, view weather data, and see a 24-hour forecast. 

The webpage uses an API to fetch data, and with this project, I gained hands-on experience with handling API responses, displaying dynamic data, and learning how to work with JavaScript and jQuery to interact with APIs.

This project is just the beginning. There's still much more to explore, and I plan to add more features and improve the page in the future. For now, it serves as a good starting point for learning about working with external data sources and integrating them into a web application.
